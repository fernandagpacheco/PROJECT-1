Hi guys! 
This is my first project to my portfolio. 
I made a webpage inspired by Severance.
Is just something that I'm working right now, just to exercise my HTML and CSS skills.
I know that it has a lot of mistakes, but i'm just in the beginning....
Please be patient, i'm studying a lot to be a great professional. Hope you guys will understand. 
Hope you enjoy it!
